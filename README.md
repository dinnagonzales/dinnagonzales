### 👩‍💻 About Me

I’ve spent the last 10 years crafting front-end experiences using React, JavaScript, and modern UI frameworks.  
The second half of my career was spent building across the stack — exploring serverless, APIs, and AWS.

I’m refreshing my skills and leveling up in cloud engineering, with a focus on building performant, modern web apps that integrate real-world AI.
